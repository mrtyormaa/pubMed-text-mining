The
Ebolaviruses are members of the family Filoviridae (“filoviruses”) and cause severe hemhorragic fever
with human case fatality rates as high as 90%. Infection requires
attachment of the viral particle to cells and triggering of membrane
fusion between the host and viral membranes, a process that occurs
in the host endosome and is facilitated by the envelope glycoprotein
(GP). One potential strategy for therapeutic intervention is the development
of agents (antibodies, peptides, and small molecules) that can interfere
with viral entry aspects such as attachment, uptake, priming, or membrane
fusion. This paper highlights recent developments in the discovery
and evaluation of therapeutic entry inhibitors and identifies opportunities
moving forward.

==== Body
The family Filoviridae, the constituents of which are known as filoviruses,
includes five species of Ebolaviruses, two species of Marburg virus
(MARV), and one species of Cuevavirus.1,2 Infection by pathogenic filovirus species results
in severe and rapidly progressing hemorrhagic fever. Each of the Ebolavirus
species is named after the region in which it was identified: Zaire
(EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), Bundibugyo (BDBV), Tai Forest (TAFV), and Reston
(RESTV). Both EBOV and SUDV have been associated with recurring large
outbreaks; two isolates of EBOV (Guinea and Sierra Leone) are the
cause of the current epidemic in West Africa. The human case fatality
rates for each of these Ebolavirus species varies according to outbreak,
but in general EBOV has been associated with the highest mortality
(up to 90%) followed by SUDV and BDBV.3 Only one case of TAFV has been recorded, and RESTV, although lethal
to monkeys, is not known to cause human disease.4 Given this variation in attributes, it is useful to compare
the sequences among the envelope glycoproteins (GP), which are critical
for viral cell entry and the primary target for antibody responses
(elaborated below). Table 1 shows the amino
acid similarity and identity among the GPs of the five Ebolavirus
species; it is interesting to note that the two most pathogenic species
(EBOV and SUDV) are the most distantly related. The prefusion X-ray
structures for EBOV GP and SUDV GP have been reported and, although
the greater topology of the GP spike remains quite similar, there
are subtle variations.5−7 Prefusion GP roughly consists of a chalice-and-bowl
morphology, with GP1 comprising the bowl, which sits within the chalice
formed by the GP2 subunits.6,7 In this prefusion structure,
the GP2 fusion loop wraps around GP1. Ostensibly, the “post-fusion”
structures of the fusion subunit (GP2) ectodomain for EBOV and MARV
are the same, except for features of specific side chain–side
chain interactions that give rise to pH-dependent stability.8

The pathology of Ebola and Marburg viral disease (EVD
or MVD) arises from the ability of filoviruses to rapidly proliferate
in their hosts and overcome the immune response. Although the correlates
for survival in humans have not been extensively documented, it appears
that survivors of an infection with SUDV continue to produce GP-specific
antibodies as late as 12 years postinfection.9 In nonhuman primates (NHPs), protection from viral challenge afforded
by convalescent antibody therapy or monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktails
appears to involve seroconversion of the surviving animals and production
of endogenous GP-specific IgG in the range of 12 days postviral challenge.56 Ebolaviruses and MARV have broad cellular tropism,
but in natural infection macrophages and dendritic cells are the primary
targets of infection.10,11 Infected macrophages are unable
to stimulate a robust immune response and cause a “cytokine
storm” that is proposed to be the primary cause of the blood-clotting
abnormalities and vascular leakage characteristic of filovirus hemorrhagic
fever.12,13 Damage to other tissues (e.g., liver, kidneys,
vascular endothelia) is thought to contribute to hemorrhagic fever
symptoms and to late-stage multiorgan failure. Thus, any agent that
decreases the spread of the virus in early infection stages has the
potential to act as a postexposure therapeutic or pre-exposure prophylactic.

The filovirus genome contains one gene for the envelope GP. MARV
GP is encoded by a single open reading frame (ORF),14 and Ebola virus as well as Cuevavirus GP
genes express three proteins from individual partially overlapping
ORFs: GP1,2 and two secreted glycoproteins (sGP and ssGP).15−17 sGP is translated as a precursor (pre-sGP), which is cleaved by
furin protease at its C-terminus to yield mature sGP and a secreted
cleavage product (Δ-peptide). Although high levels of sGP and
Δ-peptide circulate in the blood, their respective function
during the filovirus host cell entry process remains to be elucidated.
GP is the sole protein on the viral surface, is necessary and sufficient
for infection, and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies.14,18,19 The prefusion spike consists
of three copies each of the two GP subunits, GP1, which mediates cell
recognition and uptake, and GP2, which performs the viral membrane
fusion reaction. GP1 and GP2 are disulfide bonded in the prefusion
spike and result from furin cleavage of a single GP0 precursor.20−22 A brief overview of GP structure and the filovirus entry process
is provided here; readers are referred elsewhere for detailed descriptions.18,19,23,24 Filovirus particles are filamentous and studded on the exterior
by GP spike assemblies which, in the prefusion form, consist of three
copies each of GP1 and GP2. Viral particles bind to the cell and are
taken up via a macropinocytosis-like mechanism.23,25−28 GP mediates viral attachment to cells via multiple cell-surface
molecules, including lectins (e.g., L-SIGN and DC-SIGN),29−31 the tyrosine kinase receptor Axl,32 and
human T cell mucins.33 However, recent
studies indicate that the latter two enhance binding and entry of
Ebolaviruses into host cells by interacting with phosphatidylserines
in the viral membrane rather than through interactions with the GP.34,35 As the host vesicle (containing the viral particle) matures toward
an endolysosome, there are at least three critical aspects that are
required for viral membrane fusion (Figure 1). The first is cleavage of the prefusion GP spike by host endosomal
cysteine proteases cathepsins L and B (CatL/CatB), reducing the 130
kDa GP1 subunit to ∼17 kDa; this processing removes major glycosylated
and highly variable regions and exposes a receptor binding domain.36−38 Second, an interaction between the remaining GP1 fragment and a
critical endosomal host receptor (or receptors) mediates fusion with
the endosomal membrane. Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) is one critical host
factor, and there may be others unidentified; ultimately these trigger
GP2 into its active fusogenic conformation.39−41 NPC1, a highly
conserved late endosome-residing protein, was identified from a haploid
screen and is required for Ebola virus infection in vitro and in vivo.
Other host factors involved in the architecture and trafficking of
endosomal/lysosomal compartments (cellular GTPases Rab5 and Rab7,
and members of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein-sorting (HOPS)
tethering complex) have been shown to contribute to Ebola virus cellular
uptake.28,39

Figure 1 Overview of GP-mediated viral membrane fusion.
Upon cell attachment and uptake, the prefusion spike is first processed
by CatL/CatB, leaving a 17 kDa fragment of GP1. Interaction of this
remaining fragment with NPC1, and potentially other host factors,
triggers the membrane fusion cascade. The GP2 fusion loop (FL) inserts
into the host cell, creating an extended intermediate conformation
that spans both membranes. Collapse of the N- and C-heptad repeat
regions (NHR and CHR, respectively) into a six-helix bundle is promoted
by low pH and facilitates progression to a hemifusion intermediate.
Subsequent events lead to full fusion of both membranes. All of the
steps in the fusion pathway, as well as initial cell attachment (not
shown here), are susceptible to inhibition by entry inhibitors.

Third, the decreased pH of the
maturing endosome is believed
to have a direct conformational effect on the fusion subunit, GP2.8,42−44 The primary sequence of GP2 contains an N-terminal
fusion loop that has been shown to induce membrane mixing at low pH.
By analogy to other class I fusion mechanisms, it is thought that
initial triggers result in extension of the fusion loop into the host
endosomal membrane, leading to an extended or “pre-hairpin”
intermediate.43,45,46 Collapse of this intermediate, by folding of the N- and C-terminal
heptad repeat regions (referred to as NHR and CHR, respectively) into
a six-helix bundle, is hypothesized to provide the energetic driving
force for bringing the two membranes into proximity and promoting
initial lipid mixing events. The “post-fusion” ectodomain
conformation (exemplified by the six-helix bundle structure) is strongly
promoted in low pH for both EBOV and MARV;42,44 this feature likely acts as a method for conformational control
so that this late-stage fusion conformation is promoted only in conditions
of appropriately matured endosomes and not earlier. After initial
lipid mixing events, the precise mechanism of transition to formation
of the full fusion pore through which the contents of the viral particle
enter the cell has yet to be elucidated.

Virus entry is an attractive
target for drug development, because its inhibition hinders viral
propagation at an early stage, minimizing the chance of the virus
acquiring drug resistance during a later step of the virus life cycle.
Entry inhibitors for all viruses can target any critical step of the
entry pathway by blocking fusion-associated conformational changes,
inhibiting critical protein–protein interactions, or preventing
key processing steps. Indeed, entry inhibitors reported for Ebolaviruses
and MARV have targeted both host proteins (e.g., NPC1) and viral proteins
(e.g., prefusion GP). The goal of this paper is to review efforts
within the past five years to develop Ebolavirus entry inhibitors,
placing an emphasis on chemical and structural aspects, and to identify
opportunities for future development. For simplicity, we have organized
this discussion according to class of inhibitor (antibodies, peptides,
and small molecules), but we emphasize that the themes for mechanisms
of such inhibitors run parallel in many cases. Thus, any particular
step could be inhibited by a number of different approaches. Finally,
we provide a discussion of opportunities and challenges in this area.

Therapeutic
Antibodies
There has been significant recent interest in
the use of convalescent antibody therapy or mAbs as postexposure treatments.
A large number of antibodies for EBOV have been described.47,48 Here we focus on a handful to illustrate key points. From a systemic
perspective, antibody therapies likely work by preventing viral entry
(“neutralization”) and/or activation of host complement,
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), or other functions
related to the antibody Fc region. The extent to which these independent
mechanisms contribute is not completely clear, but most antibody cocktails
that have been demonstrated to be effective in small or large animals
contain at least one mAb with neutralizing activity in vitro. Key
components of two first-generation antibody cocktails, namely, MB-003
(MappBio) and ZMab (Defyrus), were recently combined to yield ZMapp,
which demonstrates increased efficacy. ZMapp is a cocktail of three
mouse-derived mAbs against EBOV GP that were chimerized into human
IgG scaffolds (c13C6, c2G4, and c4G7).49−51 This cocktail was provided
for compassionate use in several human cases this year and has been
demonstrated to reverse the course of EVD 5 days post viral challenge
in NHPs.49 Each of the ZMapp mAbs alone
is capable of affording partial protection in guinea pigs; two of
these mAbs, c2G4 and c4G7, have neutralizing activity in vitro, whereas
the third (c13C6) requires complement pathway components.49,52,53 Moreover, recent structural analysis
has shown that none of the mutations observed in the currently circulating
West Africa EBOV strains occurred within the epitopes of the ZMapp
antibodies.54,55 In NHPs, convalescent antibody
(derived from distinct GP-vaccinated animals) provides postexposure
protection for both EBOV and MARV, up to 48 h postchallenge, and these
sera also neutralize in vitro.56 Among
the most potent neutralizing antibodies described to date are SUDV-specific
mAbs 16F6 (murine) and similar synthetic human mAbs, which can neutralize
infection by nearly two logs at midnanomolar concentrations.6,57 Two of the synthetic human antibodies (E10 and F4) as well as 16F6
can provide postexposure protection >80% in an immunocompromised
mouse model.57 However, protection of NHPs
by any antibody therapy has yet to be demonstrated for SUDV. Postexposure
protection of NHPs against any filovirus by a single mAb (as opposed
to polyclonal IgG in convalescent antibody therapies or cocktails
of mAbs) also has not been shown. An early study indicated that one
EBOV-specific mAb, KZ52, did not afford protection from challenge,
but it is unknown if altered or increased dosing would have made a
difference.48,58

At present, only two antibody–GP
X-ray crystal structure complexes have been published (Figure 2),6,7 although others are likely forthcoming,
and single-particle electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions of every
mAb in the three most efficacious mAb cocktails (MB-003, ZMAb, and
ZMapp) were recently made available.55 Combined,
these data show that KZ52, a human EBOV-specific mAb, and 16F6, a
murine SUDV-specific mAb, as well as the two chimerized antibodies
c2G4 and c4G7 bind at similar locations on the overall GP prefusion
structure, namely, at the base of the chalice-and-bowl between GP1
and GP2.5,7,59 Structures
are not available for the synthetic human mAbs E10 and F4, but competition
ELISA suggests they also bind SUDV GP in a similar location.57 Other components of the protective cocktails,
c13C6 and c1H3, bind within the glycan cap.55 The KZ52 structural epitope spans both GP1 and GP2, whereas the
16F6 epitope is contained mostly on GP1; the two structural epitopes
overlap by 10 residues. These X-ray structures in combination with
the structural information on c4G7 and c2G4 suggest that the GP1–GP2
interface of the prefusion spike is particularly susceptible for neutralization.5,7 Thus, a potential strategy for isolating additional neutralizing
antibodies, or non-antibody protein therapeutics, would be to target
specifically this region on GP.

One paradoxical attribute
of the SUDV mAbs 16F6, E10, and F4 and the EBOV mAb KZ52 is that,
whereas KZ52 binds with a low nanomolar dissociation constant, it
leaves ∼10% of virus unneutralized at high antibody concentrations
(>130 nM)6,60,61 in both pseudotype and authentic viral entry assays. In contrast,
16F6, E10, and F4 are all much more potent against their respective
GPs, neutralizing 2 logs or ∼99% at much lower antibody concentrations.
These mAbs bind with affinities in the micromolar range and 16F6
has a much smaller structural epitope than KZ52.5,6 Within the synthetic antibody panel from which E10 and F4 were discovered
(all highly related in terms of sequence), there was reasonable correlation
between neutralization potency and binding affinity.57 However, at a broader level it appears that binding affinity
is not predictive of neutralization potency, nor is neutralization
predictive of protection in animals. There are likely other regions
in GP that contain neutralizing epitopes that could be mined to some
extent by naïve library phage panning or mouse immunizations.
Furthermore, GP from EBOV is known to undergo some subtle conformational
changes upon exposure to low pH or mild denaturants.62,63 It is possible that cryptic epitopes exist and are accessible on
the prefusion structure that can be targeted using a variety of approaches.60 Antibodies against the glycan cap and mucin-like
domains (e.g., 13F6 and 14G7) provide in vivo protection, but usually
appear non-neutralizing in vitro, possibly due to the removal of their
epitopes through cathepsin cleavage in the late endosome.50,53,55,64

From the structural and binding data, it is tempting to assume
that the mechanism of antibody neutralization is prevention of fusion-associated
conformational changes, but there is little direct evidence for this.
Initial cell attachment of filovirus particles is mediated through
glycans of the heavily glycosylated mucin-like domain, far away from
the sites of binding for KZ52, 16F6, E10, and F4, and therefore inhibition
of cell attachment is not likely part of their mechanism.31,65,66 Additionally, Dias et al. found
that 16F6 and KZ52 did not block cellular attachment or inhibit cathepsin
L cleavage.6 However, because triggering
of the viral membrane fusion pathway is dependent upon endosomal factors
such as CatL/B, NPC1, and low pH, a model whereby neutralizing antibodies
function by blocking fusion-associated conformational changes would
necessitate the antibody–GP complex survives with some reasonable
lifetime in the endosome. A potential mechanism for KZ52 is to act
as a “staple”, locking the two subunits together in
the prefusion form, because its structural epitope spans both subunits.7 However, this mechanism would posit that KZ52
must remain bound to GP throughout maturation of the endosome, presumably
to the lysosome where the viral particle is degraded before it has
a chance to infect. A similar mechanism can be proposed for 16F6 and,
by extension, E10 and F4, but the 16F6 structural epitope is contained
mostly on GP1; thus it is less clear how 16F6 binding can occlude
GP2 conformational rearrangements as efficiently as KZ52.5 A structural and mechanistic dissection of these
potential neutralization mechanisms may lend itself to the design
of new, more potent antibodies or protein therapeutics. Moreover,
efficient antibody-mediated protection likely requires a mixture of
antibodies that recognize both the GP1–GP2 interface and the
outer regions of the GP. In regard to this, KZ52, which failed to
provide protection as a single mAb in NHP studies,58 might be effective in an adequate antibody cocktail.

Peptide
Entry Inhibitors
Peptides present an alternative to antibodies
for targeting proteins, owing to their ease of synthesis in small
scale and potential for chemical modification to improve features
such as structure and stability. Precisely folded peptides can be
utilized to engage in numerous energetically favorable contacts over
a relatively large surface. In addition, peptides serve as excellent
tools to identify key pharmacophores and can act as templates on which
small molecules that mimic those interactions can be developed. One
FDA-approved peptide drug is the human immunodeficiency virus type
1 (HIV-1) fusion inhibitor Fuzeon (enfurvitide/T-20), which corresponds
to the CHR of the gp41 fusion subunit.67 It is thought that Fuzeon and related peptides (“C-peptides”)
work by binding the NHR segments during the extended/pre-hairpin intermediate
and preventing formation of the six-helix bundle that is critical
for membrane fusion. This approach has been applied to several class
I viruses, and similar concepts have been applied to class II viruses.68,69

Early attempts to develop C-peptides against filoviruses yielded
mixed results; one report showed that a peptide corresponding to the
CHR could reduce the infectivity of pseudotyped virus, albeit at high
concentrations, but another study suggested similar peptides had little
activity.70,71 One potential issue with development of
a filovirus C-peptide is accessibility of the putative target, the
transient extended intermediate. It is presumed that the initial membrane
fusion events are not triggered until the virus is deep within the
endocytic pathway, because early steps require host endosomal resident
proteins (CatL/CatB and NPC1).36,40 Therefore, any therapeutic
seeking to engage mid- or late-stage fusion intermediates, such as
the GP2 extended intermediate, would have to be present in endosomal
compartments.

To overcome these challenges, targeted EBOV C-peptides
have been developed in which CHR segments are localized to endosomal
compartments or membranes by conjugation to cell penetrating peptide
(CPP) domains or cholesterol. One study demonstrated that the potency
of C-peptide inhibitors can be substantially enhanced by conjugation
to the HIV-1 Tat arginine-rich sequence (referred to as Tat-Ebo).72 The antiviral activity of these endosome-targeting
peptides is dependent on both the Tat sequence and the native EBOV
CHR sequence. Mechanistic studies suggested that the peptide acts
by blocking a membrane fusion intermediate, although this was not
unequivocally demonstrated, but defects were evident in late-stage
entry steps. However, the concentrations of peptide required for substantial
reduction in viral infection are likely too high for the C-peptide
to be of clinical relevance. Subsequent efforts focused on the generation
and characterization of C-peptides conjugated to cholesterol and Tat-Ebo
analogues containing covalent side chain–side chain cross-links
to promote α-helical conformation.73 Although the mechanism of inhibition appears to be unspecific (the
peptides also showed activity against the vesicular stomatitis virus
glycoprotein G), the cholesterol-conjugated C-peptides were potent
inhibitors of EBOV glycoprotein-mediated cell entry. Interestingly,
it was found that cholesterol conjugation enhances α-helical
structure in a concentration-independent manner. These results highlight
that caution must be exercised in considering cholesterol conjugated
C-peptides as a general therapeutic approach to improve the antiviral
activity of C-peptide analogues of class I fusion proteins. In the
specific case of EBOV, conjugation to cholesterol enhanced potency
but at the cost of specificity. Moreover, side chain–side chain
cross-linking enhanced α-helical stability of the Tat-Ebo variants
only at neutral pH. However, one side chain–side chain cross-linked
peptide with moderately higher activity than the parent compound Tat-Ebo
was identified. Recently, a mirror image phage display strategy was
utilized to develop reverse chirality peptides (d-peptides)
that bind to mimics of the EBOV extended intermediate.74

Although MARV does not produce a Δ-peptide
(C-terminal cleavage product of sGP secreted by Ebola virus-infected
cells), Fc-tagged versions of EBOV, SUDV, and TAFV Δ-peptides
specifically inhibited entry by Ebolaviruses and Marburg virus, indicating
that they interfere with a pathway used by all filoviruses to gain
entry into their target cells.75 It seems
likely that other aspects of GP-mediated viral entry could be targeted
with peptides, perhaps acting as starting points for the development
of small molecules or themselves acting as potential therapeutic candidates.
For example, cyanovirin N (CVN) is a small 10 kDa glycan-binding protein
that binds mannose-containing oligosaccharides and, thus, inhibits
viral entry of diverse enveloped viruses that possess glycoproteins
with a high density of oligomannose glycosylation sites, including
HIV-1, hepatitis C, measles, and EBOV, presumably by preventing initial
virus glycan–cell interactions.76−78 CVN was also able to
delay death due to EBOV challenge in a murine model, although this
required multiple high doses.76 Given this,
it is conceivable that other peptide inhibitors that can prevent virus–cell
attachment may hold promise as entry inhibitors and would have the
added advantage that they need not function in the endosome. Later
points in the entry pathway might also be susceptible to inhibition
by peptides including virus–receptor interactions.

Small Molecules
A unique advantage that small molecules possess, particularly in
the context of emergency prophylactic or postexposure therapeutics,
is that they are orally available and would likely not require refrigeration.
Numerous small molecule therapeutics against the filoviruses have
been described, some with demonstrated efficacy in nonhuman primates.
These compounds fall into a broad range of mechanistic classes, perhaps
the most advanced being polymerase inhibitors;79 we focus here on entry inhibitors. An overview of lead
compounds and their targets is shown in Table 2. Roughly speaking, these small molecules can be categorized as follows:
(i) broad-spectrum viral entry inhibitors, targeting host proteases
or the viral membrane; (ii) inhibitors that target specifically elements
of filovirus entry, such as GP or NPC1; and (iii) FDA-approved therapeutics
that have been repurposed for filoviruses but for which the mechanisms
of action are unclear (cationic amphiphiles).

Table 2 Small Molecule Entry Inhibitors for Ebolaviruses
Within the first category
are numerous cysteine cathepsin inhibitors. Cysteine cathepsin proteases
are susceptible to mechanism-based suicide inhibitors such as epoxide-containing
or diazomethane-containing compounds.36 Using the selective CatB inhibitor CA074 and the CatL/CatB inhibitor
FYdmk, an essential role for CatB and an accessory role for CatL in
EBOV GP-dependent target cell entry could be identified. More recent
efforts for targeting CatL include oxocarbazate80 or more diverse structures isolated from a library screen.81 In all cases, inhibition was observed with pseudotyped
virus cell-based entry assays and with authentic viruses in some cases.
In vitro, there appears to be a strong but not absolute dependence
on CatB for GP-mediated entry by some filoviruses (EBOV, TAFV, BDBV),
whereas CatL is less critical.36,37,82 Other filoviruses (SUDV and MARV) do not require CatB.82 In vivo, CatB and CatL knockout mice are both
still susceptible to EBOV infection and death, suggesting that redundant
proteolytic mechanisms may exist.83 Moreover,
EBOV can readily adapt to use non-CatB cysteine cathepsins, at least
in tissue culture, and a similar situation may exist in animals. Thus,
a likely requirement for filovirus entry inhibitors is potent, broad-spectrum
inhibition of cysteine proteases residing in the endocytic pathway
of all cells. Targeting a general mechanism such as cathepsin cleavage
may prove advantageous in that such agents could be used for other
endosomal viruses that also require these proteases (such as severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV);81 however, a potential disadvantage may be toxicity due to
loss of host protease function. A critical consideration for these
compounds may be whether systemic toxicity (if any) can be tolerated
within the required treatment window for postexposure therapy. Several
of the epoxide-based cathepsin inhibitors are well-tolerated in mice
upon prolonged administration, an important factor in the consideration
of compounds with this mechanism of action.84−86

An alternative
to targeting a general host factor is to target the viral membrane,
a task that has been accomplished recently with the aryl methyldiene
rhodanine derivative LJ001.87 The proposed
mechanism of this compound and its derivates is specific intercalation
into membranes. Unlike biogenic mammalian cells, virions lack the
ability to repair membrane damage. Thus, while being capable of binding
both membrane types, LJ001 inhibits only virus–cell but not
cell–cell fusion, because the intercalation probably causes
defects in membrane architecture, and the activation of a thioxo functionality
leads to local membrane damage. LJ001 had potent in vitro antiviral
activity against EBOV and a number of other enveloped viruses, including
influenza A, flaviviruses, poxviruses, and HIV-1. Although 80% of
mice pretreated with LJ001 survived a lethal dose of mouse-adapted
EBOV challenge, LJ001 did not show efficacy in postexposure mouse
model experiments due to a suboptimal pharmacokinetic profile. Nonetheless,
these results provide proof-of-concept that a general membrane-targeted
reagent could serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral.

Upon cleavage,
the protein–protein interaction between cleaved GP1 and NPC1
is critical for triggering the membrane fusion machinery, although
it remains to be determined if other factors are involved.39,40 Both genetic and chemical ablations of this interaction have been
shown to reduce infectivity in vitro and, in NPC1 heterozygotic (NPC1+/− mice), there is a substantial resistance to both
EBOV and MARV lethal challenge. Protein–protein interactions
have been a challenging class of targets for antagonism with small
molecules, because interfacial surfaces are usually large, dynamic,
and lack deep binding pockets into which a small molecule could bind
and efficiently occlude the interaction.88 Nonetheless, an adamantane class of compounds (e.g., 3.47) appears to function by preventing GP binding to NPC1.40 A parent compound, 3.0, was identified
from a small molecule screen for inhibition of pseudotyped virus infection,
specific to EBOV GP. Subsequent structure–activity relationship
(SAR) analysis and pull-down experiments suggested this class interacts
directly with NPC1 and inhibits a GP–NPC1 interaction.89 However, neither a direct KD measurement nor structural evidence of the small molecule–NPC1
interaction has been reported. A separate small molecule screen identified
a benzodiazepine derivative (compound 7), which likely
targets a hydrophobic pocket (S2) at the GP1–GP2 interface
in the prefusion conformation, as evidenced by ablation of activity
upon mutation of specific GP residues.90 Whereas it remains to be determined whether compound 7 inhibits GP–NPC1 interactions or prevents GP-associated conformational
changes, these studies suggest that the S2 hydrophobic pocket can
serve as a well-defined small molecule drug target for the inhibition
of EBOV infection.

A third mechanistic class includes cationic
amphiphiles, which have been isolated from multiple screens of FDA-approved
drugs. For example, the selective estrogen receptor modulators clomiphene,
used as an infertility treatment to induce ovulation, and toremifiene,
used as a breast cancer chemotherapeutic, both inhibit EBOV infection
in vitro at a late-stage entry step.91 A
broader panel of cationic amphiphiles has recently been shown to have
similar activities,92 and an independent
study identified amiodarone,93 used to
treat cardiac arrhythmias, and other ion channel inhibitors with similar
properties. The precise mechanism by which cationic amphiphiles inhibit
viral entry is not completely understood, but it appears that they
are distinct from that of 3.47 in that they do not directly
inhibit the GP–NPC1 interaction. Alternative proposed mechanisms
include allosteric modulation of NPC1, disruption of NPC1 by general
disfunction of the endolysosomal membrane, and interaction with a
yet-unidentified additional required host factor.91,92 Although the prospect of repurposing FDA-approved drugs for use
as antifilovirus drugs is appealing from the standpoint that these
agents have already passed safety studies, it is important to emphasize
that dosing will likely be a critical issue. Such compounds likely
have a very specific treatment window for their intended indications,
and their use as antifilovirus drugs may require increased amounts
to combat the high viral titers that may go beyond the approved therapeutic
window. Nonetheless, the in vitro data for these compounds are compelling
enough to warrant further evaluation in animals.

In addition
to the classes listed above, Yermolina et al. reported a newly developed
antifiloviral screening system based on EBOV-GP pseudotyped HIV particles
to identify compound 8a, which selectively inhibited
EBOV and MARV infection in human cells.94 Although subsequent modifications improved the antiviral activity
of this lead compound, its mode of entry inhibition remains to be
elucidated.

Present Challenges and Opportunities
Among the three
classes of entry inhibitors discussed here, antibodies are the most
advanced in terms of development. Although the efficacy of cocktails,
such as ZMapp, for EBOV in nonhuman primates is clear, a challenge
moving forward will be to identify similar treatments for other filoviruses.
The convalescent serum protection studies with MARV suggest that it
can also be targeted with appropriate antibody therapies. Furthermore,
analysis of sera in NHPs treated with one broad vaccine candidate,
a mixture of vesicular stomatitis virus particles containing GPs from
EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV, suggests that induction of neutralizing antibodies
is a significant component of vaccine-induced protection.95 It therefore seems likely that protection from
other filovirus species with mAb cocktails is possible and that cross-protection
with appropriately engineered cross-neutralizing cocktails or broadly
neutralizing antibodies merits investigation. In addition, further
molecular studies on the mechanism of neutralization may yield new
insight into how to develop more potent and effective mAbs for future
development.

Peptide inhibitors of viral membrane fusion have
yielded important mechanistic insights into infection, but a critical
challenge for use of these compounds will be their in vivo half-life
and whether the extended intermediate is accessible enough to be a
viable therapeutic target. One HIV-1 C-peptide, fuzeon/enfurvirtide/T-20,
has provided some clinical utility; however, filovirus C-peptides
have the added complication that they must be delivered to endosomes
of susceptible cell types at high enough levels to induce a therapeutic
effect. Whereas conjugation to various targeting agents (CPP or cholesterol)
was an interesting and straightforward strategy, this approach may
also divert the peptides to a broad number of cell types and therefore
dilute antiviral activity. Furthermore, cationic peptides in general
suffer from high systemic toxicity. Nonetheless, such agents could
likely serve as valuable research reagents, and new peptides could
be developed to target other aspects of the entry pathway.

Small
molecule entry inhibitors that target the host or virus may prove
to be clinically useful, especially when considered as part of a cocktail
with compounds that inhibit viral replication (e.g., polymerase chain
terminators). A critical challenge moving forward will be identifying
compounds that exhibit therapeutic effects in animal models within
reasonable treatment windows. Evaluation of these compounds in mouse
protection models will be critical to prioritizing them for potential
therapeutic efficacy. As with antibodies, additional mechanistic information
specifically for the cationic amphiphiles will be beneficial from
both the basic and applied perspectives. Finally, one unexplored area
is the potential for combination of antibody and small molecules as
antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs). This approach is widely popular
for cancer therapies, and proof-of-concept has been demonstrated for
HIV-1.96,97 Such an approach could leverage the specificity
of monoclonal antibodies with the in vitro potency of small molecule
inhibitors.

Filovirus entry is a complicated process requiring
multiple endosomal components. The inhibitors discussed herein are
thought to function at a variety of steps including cell attachment
(CVN), proteolytic processing (cathepsin inhibitors), host receptor
interaction (3.47), and other aspects of membrane fusion
(C-peptides, cationic amphiphiles, and antibodies). Which of these
steps is most susceptible in vivo remains to be determined, but those
agents that target the early prefusion intermediates of GP have the
added advantage that they do not require delivery to the endosome
for function. Nonetheless, strategies that seek to disrupt these specific
steps in the pathway have all been validated in vitro, and some in
vivo, thereby paving the way for other structural and chemical approaches
to the development of filovirus entry inhibitors.
