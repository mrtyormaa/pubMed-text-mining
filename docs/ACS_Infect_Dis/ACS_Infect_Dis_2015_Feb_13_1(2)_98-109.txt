An
ultrahigh-throughput screen was performed to identify novel
small molecule inhibitors of influenza virus replication. The screen
employed a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 virus expressing Renilla luciferase and yielded a hit rate of 0.5%,
of which the vast majority showed little cytotoxicity at the inhibitory
concentration. One of the top hits from this screen, designated S20,
inhibits HA-mediated membrane fusion. S20 shows potent antiviral activity
(IC50 = 80 nM) and low toxicity (CC50 = 40 μM),
yielding a selectivity index of 500 and functionality against all
of the group 1 influenza A viruses tested in this study, including
the pandemic H1N1 and avian H5N1 viruses. Mechanism of action studies
proved a direct S20–HA interaction and showed that S20 inhibits
fusion by stabilizing the prefusion conformation of HA. In silico
docking studies were performed, and the predicted binding site in
HA2 corresponds with the area where resistance mutations occurred
and correlates with the known role of this region in fusion. This
high-throughput screen has yielded many promising new lead compounds,
including S20, which will potentially shed light on the molecular
mechanisms of viral infection and serve as research tools or be developed
for clinical use as antivirals.

==== Body
Influenza viruses are enveloped,
negative-stranded RNA viruses that are part of the Orthomyxoviridae
family. Influenza A and B viruses are a major cause of human respiratory
disease and account for up to 5 million cases of severe disease and
500,000 deaths per year worldwide (WHO). Periodic pandemics of antigenically
novel influenza A viruses exacerbate these levels of morbidity and
mortality due to the lack of pre-existing immunity in the population.
The most recent occurrence was the novel swine H1N1 pandemic virus
of 2009,1−3 but the greatest example of the destructive potential
of a pandemic was that which occurred in 1918 and caused an estimated
50–100 million deaths worldwide.4

The influenza virus membrane contains three proteins: hemagglutinin
(HA), neuraminidase (NA), and the proton channel (M2). Early in infection
HA is responsible for binding to sialic acid receptors and, after
uptake into endosomes, for pH-dependent fusion of virus and host membranes.5 Once in the late endosome the M2 channel allows
for protons to pass into the virion, where the low pH facilitates
uncoating of the viral particle and release of the genome through
the fusion pore. NA acts later in infection and has the enzymatic
function of cleaving sialic acid from glycoproteins to allow release
of budding particles from the cell surface. NA inhibitors (oseltamivir
and zanamivir) target the NA protein, and adamantanes (amantadine
and rimantadine) target the transmembrane domain of the M2 protein.

Influenza continues to be a significant threat to public health,
and the inadequate production of vaccine for the recent 2009 pandemic
underscores the need for antivirals.6 Currently,
NA inhibitors are the only drugs recommended for clinical use by the
CDC as the circulating strains of both H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses
are resistant to the adamantane class of drugs. Also, the H1N1 viruses
circulating prior to the 2009 pandemic presented nearly complete resistance
to oseltamivir without any loss in fitness,7 and there are sporadic reports of oseltamivir resistance among contemporary
H1N1 viruses, too.8−12 Taken together, these facts emphasize the need for new influenza-specific
antiviral drugs with novel mechanisms of action to be used in conjunction
with current treatments to control infection and reduce incidences
of resistance. This strategy would mimic the well-established success
of the highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) against HIV13 and the recent advancements in HCV treatment.46

The influenza virus HA protein is a homotrimer,
in which each monomer
is composed of two disulfide-linked subunits named HA1 and HA2. HA1
forms the head region of the protein, which is primarily involved
in the receptor binding function of HA, whereas HA2 is referred to
as the stem region and is involved in the virus–host membrane
fusion process. Following viral binding and uptake into the endosome,
the low-pH environment triggers irreversible conformational changes
within the HA. The hydrophobic fusion peptide of the HA is exposed
from its buried position and is followed by several structural rearrangements
of the HA2, which ends in fusion of the host and viral membranes.
This membrane fusion facilitates the release of viral ribonucleoproteins
(RNPs) from the virion into the cytoplasm. Upon release they are trafficked
to the nucleus, where the genome is replicated and transcribed.45

Several small molecules that inhibit these
conformational changes
required for membrane fusion by the HA protein have been identified
in recent years.14−22 These studies have highlighted the HA-mediated membrane fusion process
as a relevant target for antiviral development. The obstacle that
is frequent among these fusion inhibitors is that they are all limited
by subtype specificity. There are currently 18 known HA subtypes of
influenza A virus,23 which can be divided
into two broad phylogenetic groups: group 1 (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9,
H11, H12, H13, H16, H17, and H18) and group 2 (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14,
and H15). Most of the inhibitors that target HA are restricted to
blocking fusion of either group 1 or group 2 HA proteins. The fact
that current seasonal circulating influenza viruses include both group
1 (H1) and group 2 (H3) makes it important that a future clinical
inhibitor has pan-subtype efficacy or that both group 1 and group
2 inhibitors are included in a drug cocktail. Discovery of new inhibitors
of this class and further understanding of their collective mechanisms
are key to developing effective therapies.

In a recent screen
of 919,960 compounds we have found several potent
influenza-specific inhibitors of viral replication with submicromolar
IC50 concentrations. One of these compounds, which we have
termed S20, was determined to be an inhibitor of HA-mediated
membrane fusion for group 1 influenza A viruses. In this study we
explore the mechanism of action of this inhibitor in depth and propose
its continued development to expand efficacy against all influenza
A viruses.

Results and Discussion
Identification of Potent Influenza Virus
Inhibitors Using a
Cell-Based High-Throughput Screen Assay
A cell-based assay
that allows for multicycle influenza virus replication, and thus the
ability to capture inhibitors of all steps in the viral life cycle,
was developed for the purposes of a high-throughput screen (HTS).
This assay used a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 virus that had been
engineered to express Renilla luciferase27 (Figure 1a). Briefly,
the open-reading frame for the viral HA gene was replaced with that
of Renilla luciferase. The packaging signals of the
HA segment were maintained to ensure that the recombinant segment
is incorporated into progeny virions. As this WSN-Renilla virus lacks the ability to express HA, it can undergo multicycle
replication only in an HA complementing cell line (MDCK-HA). For the
HTS assay MDCK-HA cells were plated in solid white 1536-well plates
and incubated overnight at 37 °C (Figure 1b). Two hours prior to infection, media containing library or control
compounds (2 μM in DMSO) were added to each well. Cells were
then infected with the WSN-Renilla virus at a multiplicity
of infection (MOI) of 0.05 and infection was allowed to proceed for
an additional 30 h. Renilla luciferase activity was
determined using a luminescent readout, which served as a measurement
of viral replication. The luminescent signal from the wells containing
library compounds was compared to those containing positive controls
(ribavirin and oseltamivir) and DMSO as the negative control. As an
NA inhibitor, oseltamivir affects the very last stage of the viral
life cycle, the release step. Thus, inhibition by oseltamivir can
be seen only in the context of multicycle infections, so its inclusion
and effectiveness ensured that multicycle replication was occurring
in our assay and that inhibitors of the release step, as well as all
prior steps, could be detected. Ribavirin, which is a broad-spectrum
inhibitor of RNA viruses and targets polymerase function, showed an
even larger window of inhibition because it targets an earlier step
in the life cycle. The screen assay was determined to have a Z′ factor between 0.4 and 0.6, a CV ranging from
10 to 20%, and a signal window of 5–7-fold, indicating that
it was robust and would yield relevant hits.

design and execution: recombinant influenza
virus and high-throughput screen design and results. (a) Schematic
of the recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 virus expressing Renilla luciferase. The Renilla luciferase open reading
frame was inserted in the reverse orientation and complementary sense
between the 3′ and 5′ packaging sequences of the HA
segment, which contains the viral promoter and ensures correct packaging
of the recombinant segment. Due to the lack of HA ORF, this WSN-Renilla virus must be grown in an HA-complementing cell
line. Upon infection, the influenza virus polymerase recognizes the
promoter and the reporter gene is transcribed and expressed. (b) MDCK-HA
cells were plated in 1536-well plates and infected with WSN-Renilla virus (MOI = 0.05). Compounds were added 120 min
prior to infection, and expression of Renilla luciferase
was assayed 30 h later. A 50% reduction in luminescence signal was
employed as a cutoff. (c) Results from the HTS of 919,960 compounds
indicating the number of primary hits, the hits confirmed in dose–response,
and the selection of hits for revalidation.

In this study, 919,960 compounds from the academic library
at the
Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) were
screened. The GNF Academic Screening Collection consists of a collection
of compounds that were selected after applying proprietary algorithms
designed to select for optimal compound properties and eliminate undesirable
functional groups The screen yielded 4582 hits (0.5% hit rate) that
met the cutoff of 50% inhibition (Figure 1c).
These hits where then tested in an 8-point dose response confirmation
screen in 96-well format in the presence of reporter virus or in the
absence of virus for a cytotoxicity counter-screen. Seven hundred
and forty-four compounds were confirmed with an IC50 <
2 μM and CC50 > 2 μM. Structural analysis
of
the validated hit compounds revealed that they could be clustered
into 420 groups based on distinct structural scaffolds. Of these groups,
360 were composed of a single compound with no structural relatives
within the screen hits, whereas the other 60 groups contained between
2 and 31 related small molecules. The most potent compound from each
scaffold was then reordered from commercial vendors and revalidated
with the reporter virus assay. Of the 420 compounds, 250 were verified
for activity and these were next tested in an 8-point dose response
assay against wild type influenza A/WSN/33 virus in non-HA-expressing
MDCK cells. Viral titers were assessed initially through hemagglutination
assay and then by plaque assay. Compounds that showed significant
antiviral effects were then reassessed for cytotoxicity to compile
a set of compounds with IC50 values <1 μM, selective
indices (SI = CC50/IC50) >40, and maximum
viral
titer reductions of ≥1 log.

Whereas most previous screens
have relied on indirect readouts
such as cytopathic effect or have utilized mini-replicon systems that
exclude the entry and egress stages of the viral life cycle, our luciferase
reporter virus, in combination with MDCK cells stably expressing the
HA protein, provides a direct readout of viral gene expression in
the context of the entire replication cycle and therefore is capable
of identifying compounds such as the egress inhibitor oseltamivir.
Using this system we identified 21 compounds that inhibit influenza
A/WSN/33 replication as well as or better than oseltamivir in cell
culture.

S20 Is a Specific Inhibitor of Influenza A Virus
One
of the most potent compounds to emerge from our secondary screening
and validation assays was designated S20 (structure indicated
in Figure 2a). Compound S20 potently
inhibited viral replication of the wild type WSN and WSN-Renilla viruses in MDCK or MDCK-HA cells, respectively. When tested against
wild type WSN in the physiologically more relevant A549 (human lung
epithelial) cells, even greater inhibition of viral titers was detected
with an IC50 value of 80 nM and a maximum reduction in
viral titer of >3 logs (Figure 2b). Cytotoxicity
remained low in A549 cells with a CC50 value of 40 μM,
yielding an impressive SI of 500. S20 also showed activity
against other influenza A viruses such as A/California/04/09 (H1N1)
and A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1), but viruses of the H3N2 subtype appear
to be naturally resistant to the inhibitory effects of S20 (Table 1). S20 also failed to
impact the replication of influenza B virus and vesicular stomatitis
virus, indicating that it is a specific inhibitor of influenza A viruses,
particularly the H1N1 and H5N1 subtypes.

S20 Inhibits Influenza Entry and Targets the HA Protein
To determine whether S20 acts at an early or a late
stage of the viral life cycle, time of addition studies were conducted
at an MOI of 1 with S20 treatments at −2, 0, 2,
4, 6, and 8 h relative to infection. S20 inhibited virus
growth only when added prior to infection, indicating that the compound
is likely acting during one of the early entry steps in the life cycle
(Figure 3a). This correlates well with the
lack of activity observed for S20 in the influenza A
mini-genome system, which reconstitutes only influenza transcription/replication
and would not detect inhibitors of viral entry or egress (data not
shown). Next, we employed a pseudotyped particle assay to determine
if S20 directly inhibits HA-mediated entry. This system
utilizes a replication deficient HIV provirus expressing gaussia luciferase
that was pseudotyped with either influenza virus HA and NA or the
VSV G protein as a control.27 As indicated
in Figure 3b, S20 potently inhibited
entry of the particles pseudotyped with HA/NA while having no effect
on the VSV control. As expected, the replication inhibitor A3, which
targets the cellular protein DHODH,30 had
no effect on the pseudotyped particle entry, indicating that this
was a specific effect of S20.

Figure 3 S20 inhibits
at early times during infection and is
effective against HA-mediated viral entry. (a) Time-of-addition assay
for inhibition of influenza A/WSN/33 virus by S20. A549
cells were infected with influenza virus A/WSN/33 (MOI = 1). Compound S20 was present in the culture medium 2 h before infection
or added to the medium at the indicated time points postinfection
at its CC10 concentration. Viral titers were determined
24 h postinfection by plaque assay. The assay was performed in triplicate;
results are presented as the mean ± SD. (b) Inhibitory activity
of S20 at the indicated concentrations on infection of
A549 cells with luciferase-expressing lentiviruses pseudotyped with
VSV-G or WSN HA and NA. The non-entry inhibitor A3 has no effect on
the pseudotyped particle system and served as a negative control.
The samples were tested in triplicate, and the data are presented
as the mean ± SD.

In an attempt to determine whether S20 is targeting
a viral protein, we selected for S20 resistant influenza
viruses. Briefly, influenza A/WSN/33 virus was passaged in A549 cells
at an MOI of 0.01 in the presence of the maximum concentration (0.5
μM) of S20 that yielded enough virus for subsequent
passages at the same MOI. Following four passages under these conditions,
resistant viruses were isolated in seven independent experiments,
with three virus plaques purified from each and submitted for complete
sequencing of the viral genome. Fourteen of the 21 sequenced viruses
contained mutations, revealing 10 single amino acid changes (Figure 4a). All of these mutations were in the HA gene,
indicating that this is the likely target of S20. Eight
of 10 of these mutations occurred either within or surrounding the
large “B” loop structure, which connects the large and
small α-helices of the HA2 subunit. This B loop in HA2 is thought
to be the “spring” in the proposed spring-loaded mechanism
of HA-mediated membrane fusion due to its high propensity for helical
conformation.31 We found that these resistance-associated
residues were conserved among HAs from group 1, but not group 2 (Figure 4b), offering a possible explanation for the group
1 specificity of S20. Within the loop itself there were
three mutations (A65 V, T61I, and M59I, using WSN HA2 amino acid numbering),
the large α-helix had one mutation (K75R) adjacent to the top
of the loop, and two mutations were found in the small α-helix
(V52I and N50S) near the bottom of the loop. Interestingly, two of
the mutations occurred within the HA1 subunit (K321T and M330 V).
Although distant within the primary sequence, these mutations in HA1
align perfectly with the loop region of HA2, further highlighting
this region as likely important for S20 inhibition. Two
other mutations occurred within HA2, but outside this loop region
(N114S and V122A). These mutations within the stalk that are not localized
near the B loop could possibly cause resistance to S20 by decreasing the stability of the prefusion conformation of HA,
therefore allowing fusion to be triggered more easily and bypassing S20 inhibition. Indeed, a mutation at position 114 of HA2
has previously been shown to allow fusion to occur at higher pH,35 suggesting destabilization of the native HA
conformation. To confirm resistance, the M59I mutation was introduced
into a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 virus using reverse genetics.28 The virus rWSN-M59I was not impaired for growth
compared to a wild type recombinant virus under multicycle conditions
(data not shown), but did show resistance to S20 inhibition
with a 20-fold higher IC50 value compared with WT rWSN
(Figure 4c), confirming the importance of this
residue for S20 antiviral activity. A compound structurally
related to S20, MBX2546, was recently reported to inhibit
fusion in a similar manner to what we propose for S20 in this work, but no resistance mutation was identified in that
study.21 In Figure 4d, we show that the M59I mutation, which falls within the region
predicted to bind to MBX2546,21 also causes
resistance to that compound. When the M59I mutation was analyzed within
the pseudotyped particle entry assay, a similar resistance phenotype
was observed (Figure 4e).

effects of S20. (a) Crystal structure of A/PR/8/34 HA

are presented as the mean ± SD.

S20 Stabilizes the HA Prefusion Conformation and Inhibits HA-Mediated
Membrane Fusion
The resistance mutations within the HA stalk
indicated that HA-mediated fusion may be affected by S20. The B loop structure and the surrounding region within HA2 in which
the S20 resistance mutations occur have been extensively
studied. A conformational change from a loop to a helical structure
is a critical step in HA-mediated membrane fusion,32,33 facilitating fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes during
influenza virus entry. To determine whether S20 was inhibiting
the HA membrane fusion machinery, we employed a hemolysis assay, which
measures the ability of influenza virus to induce membrane fusion
and lysis of red blood cells under low-pH conditions. In this assay S20 displayed potent inhibition of fusion induced at a pH
of 5 (Figure 5a), whereas the rWSN-M59I virus
was resistant to this effect and appeared similar to the negative
control. Previously, we had observed S20 to have subtype
specificity for influenza A viruses with group 1 HAs (H1N1 and H5N1)
while having no appreciable effect on viruses with group 2 HAs (H3N2).
To confirm this specificity, the ability of S20 to inhibit
the fusion of a virus with a group 2 HA was tested. No effect of S20 on influenza A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) fusion was observed
in this assay at a maximum concentration of 50 μM (data not
shown).

Figure 5 S20 blocks HA-mediated membrane fusion in a pH-dependent
manner. After mixing a suspension of chicken erythrocytes with (a,
b) rWSN-WT virus or (c) rWSN-HA/M59I virus on ice, S20 was added at the indicated concentrations. The mixture was then
acidified with a pH of either (a) 5 or (b, c) a range from 4.8 to
6. The suspension was then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and
assayed at 340 nM for NADH released from the erythrocytes, as a measurement
of fusion. Data are expressed as percentage relative to the DMSO control
and means of triplicates ± SD are shown. (d, e) Trypsin sensitivity
assay showing S20 protection of purified (d) WT HA but not (e) HA-M59I
from trypsin digestion in a pH-dependent manner. Purified A/WSN/33
HA was incubated with DMSO (D) or S20 at the CC10 concentration for 15 min at 31 °C prior to acidification to
the indicated pH. The mixture was neutralized to a final pH of 7.4
and treated with trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C. The extent of trypsin
cleavage was analyzed on a gradient SDS-PAGE gel and visualized with
Coomassie staining. Trypsin digestion of HA at neutral pH (pH 7.4)
was used as a control and is shown in the first lane.

We were then interested in testing the pH dependence
of S20 fusion inhibition, so we varied the pH of fusion
activation from
6 to 4.8 in the presence of DMSO or 20 μM S20.
Under these conditions we observed S20 inhibition of
fusion from pH 6 down to 5. When the pH was lowered to 4.8, inhibition
by S20 was lost and fusion was identical to that of the
DMSO control (Figure 5b). Of note, the rWSN-M59I
virus showed no difference in the optimal pH for fusion whether in
the presence of DMSO or S20 (Figure 5c). To investigate whether S20 was inhibiting
fusion by directly blocking the low-pH conformational change of HA,
a trypsin digestion assay was used, which detects exposure of cryptic
trypsin cleavage sites in HA during the prefusion to postfusion conformational
change. As indicated in Figure 5d, the purified
baculovirus expressed HA was protected from trypsin digestion at pH
5 when in the presence of S20, but this effect was lost
at lower pH, similar to observations in the fusion experiments. The
M59I mutant HA showed minimal protection by S20 at a
pH of 5, again providing evidence for the central role of this residue
in S20 activity. Of the possible modes of inhibiting
HA-mediated membrane fusion, the most common is prevention of HA refolding
into its postfusion conformation. Alternatively, a fusion inhibitor
can also function via premature triggering of the fusion machinery
and therefore irreversibly block the process. The fact that S20 inhibition can be overcome at pH 4.8 indicates that it
is stabilizing the prefusion conformation of HA, and this is supported
by the results of a tryptic digestion assay, where S20 protected HA from conversion to its trypsin-sensitive conformation
under low-pH conditions.

S20 Binds to the Influenza HA Protein
The S20 resistance mutations that were selected within
the influenza HA
protein are suggestive of a direct interaction between the compound
and protein. To examine this further, we used biolayer interferometry
(BLI) to detect binding of S20 to the WSN HA protein.
BLI is a technique that detects real-time binding of small molecules
to an immobilized protein through shifts in interference patterns
of white light passed through the biolayer containing the protein.34 We found that S20 binds to baculovirus-expressed
and purified WSN HA in a dose-dependent manner with a calculated Kd of 5.29 μM (Figure 6a). As a negative control, ribavirin was tested at 5-fold
higher concentrations, and no binding to HA was observed (data not
shown). When binding to purified WSN HA containing the M59I mutation
was tested, we found that S20 had a 6-fold lower affinity
with a Kd of 30.9 μM, suggesting
that this loop region of the stalk is the site of interaction. Whereas
the loss of binding was small with the mutant HA (6-fold), it is in
line with the finding that the HA/M59I recombinant virus showed only
a moderate resistant phenotype with 20-fold lower sensitivity to S20. Mutations within this region that cause a greater loss
in binding activity would likely yield more impressive resistance
profiles, but this may also be accompanied by a decrease in viral
fitness. When tested against the Perth/09 HA, an H3 that is resistant
to S20 inhibition, no binding of S20 was
observed. As a positive control, we used the compound tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), previously described in the literature
to bind to and inhibit group 2 HAs.20 TBHQ
bound to Perth/09 HA with a Kd of 5.3
μM, indicating the protein was of proper quality for binding
experiments (data not shown). The binding data best fit to a 2:1 binding
model, suggesting two binding modes for S20 on HA. The
secondary association event that was detected through BLI probably
reflects nonspecific binding, which is unrelated to the antiviral
activity of S20. We believe this to be true because the
affinity of the secondary binding is 2 orders of magnitude lower than
that of the primary interaction (Figure 6a).
Also, this secondary binding is unchanged in the presence of the S20 resistance mutation M59I, further suggesting that it is
unrelated to the antiviral activity of S20.

Figure 6 S20 directly binds to the influenza virus hemagglutinin
protein. (a) Biolayer interferometry was used to assay the binding
of the small molecule S20 to purified WSN HA protein.
The association and dissociation curves of increasing concentrations
of S20 binding to WT WSN HA are shown. A negative control
of buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween-20, 10% DMSO) containing no HA was run
for each experiment. The affinity of S20 for HA–WT
and HA–M59I was calculated and represented as two separate
dissociation constants for the high-affinity specific interaction
(KD1) and the low-affinity nonspecific binding (KD2). A χ2 of 0.0344 and an R2 of 0.93 indicate
that the binding data fit to this 2:1 binding model (i.e., two binding
events on HA). (b) NMR binding of S20 to WT WSN HA via
saturation transfer difference (STD). Overlay of the aromatic region
of on-resonance (0.5 ppm, red) and off-resonance (20 ppm, blue) 1H NMR spectra of 75 μM compound S20 (resonances
between 6.6 and 7.0 ppm, black dots) and 75 μM of a unrelated
small molecule used as negative control (resonances between 8.5 and
7.25 ppm, asterisks) in PBS, pH 7.4 (+10% D2O) in the presence
of 7.5 μM WT WSN HA. Selective attenuation (saturation) of S20 protons (indicated with dots) is evident, whereas the
resonances of the negative control compound (indicated with asterisks)
appear unperturbed.

To further confirm direct
interactions between S20 and HA, we performed NMR saturation
transfer difference experiments
(STD).48,49 In this experiment, selective irradiation
of the aliphatic hydrogen nuclei is achieved by a train of selective
pulses centered at 0.5 ppm (see Methods).
This selective irradiation causes the saturation of surrounding protein
hydrogen nuclei via spin diffusion. Ultimately, by the same principle,
the saturation is transferred to the hydrogen nuclei of the bound
ligand, and the effect manifests itself in the attenuation of the
signal intensity of the compound resonances. The STD NMR spectra of S20 in the presence of wild type WSN HA are reported in Figure 6b, where the attenuation of the S20 signals in the irradiated protein spectrum is evident compared to
a negative control molecule. Binding was also observed to the M59I
mutant WSN HA in this assay, in agreement with our BLI data (data
not shown). Taken together, this suggests that S20 blocks
fusion via a specific physical interaction with group 1 influenza
HA proteins and that resistance mutations decrease the affinity of
this interaction.

In Silico Docking of S20 to the HA Crystal
Structure
The crystal structure of the PR8 HA protein was
loaded into MOE (Molecular
Operating Environment, version 2013.08). Docking simulations of S20 were performed with the MOE-dock system and allowed the
entire HA trimer to be considered for possible binding sites. Induced
fit modeling was employed to allow movement of the protein during
refinement to simulate the dynamic molecular environment. The affinity
scoring function London dG was used to assess and rank the receptor–ligand
complexes. The top-ranked docking score is shown in Figure 7. The predicted binding pocket is formed by the
large α-helix and loop of HA2 and a loop consisting of amino
acids 300–310 of HA1. This correlates well with our S20 escape mutants (residues indicated in Figure 7a), which highlighted the HA2 loop region as being important for S20 inhibition. Two of the residues, from both HA1 (K321)
and HA2 (A65), which when mutated cause S20 resistance,
form part of the surface of this predicted binding pocket (Figure 7b). S20 is predicted to form a hydrogen
bond of 1.66 Å with residue Q62 of the HA2 loop (see alignment
in Figure 4B), which is stabilized by a hydrogen
bond that forms between Q62 and K321 in HA1. Furthermore, in silico
mutagenesis studies indicate that the K321T and A65 V mutations, which
directly form the predicted binding pocket, would cause significant
losses (Δaffinity = +1.41 and 0.95, respectively) in the affinity
of S20 for the pocket. The mutation M59I caused a smaller
loss in affinity (Δaffinity = +0.20) in line with the small
loss of affinity observed via our BLI experiments. All other resistance
mutations caused no predicted loss of affinity for S20, indicating that they are not involved in the binding pocket, but
more likely causing decreases in stability of the prefusion conformation
of HA. Finally, docking of S20 with the compound-sensitive
HA from A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) (PDB 2FK0) protein yielded a similar binding pocket
within the HA2 loop structure, whereas attempts to model the compound
with the S20-resistant HA from A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) (PDB 2YPG) yielded no predicted
binding pockets within this region. Therefore, the presence of this
predicted binding pocket correlates with virus sensitivity to S20 inhibition.

of the S20 docking site in the HA trimer in the simulated
three-dimensional
structure of the A/PR/8/34 HA (PDB 1RU7) with HA1 in green and HA2 in silver.
Residues where S20 escape mutations occurred are indicated
in orange (HA1) and yellow (HA2). The Q62 residue, which forms a predicted
hydrogen bond with S20, is highlighted in light green.
(b) The surface of the docking pocket is presented with blue indicating
positive charge and red indicating negative charge; escape mutation
residues, which help form the pocket, are represented by their corresponding
color.

This loop in the prefusion HA
structure undergoes a radical conformational
change during low-pH treatment to the final postfusion conformation
in which it assumes an α-helical structure to act as the “spring”
that allows insertion of the fusion peptide into opposing membranes.31 This conformational restructuring is critical
for both the extension of the fusion peptide into the opposing membrane
and the eventual collapse of HA, via a coiled-coil structure, to bring
the two membranes within proximity for fusion to occur. S20 association with this region could stabilize the prefusion conformation
and prevent these necessary structural changes. The region of HA1
close to the HA2 loop structure is believed to act as a “clamp”
to prevent the triggering of the “spring” in the spring-loaded
mechanism of HA-mediated membrane fusion.36,37 Therefore, another possibility would be that the interaction of S20 with residues from both HA1 and HA2 may prevent the HA1
“clamp” from moving away from the stalk region, which
is a requirement for the early steps of HA-mediated fusion. We were
unable to model S20 into the H3 structure; however, HA
fusion inhibitors that are specific for group 2 HAs have been reported
and are predicted to bind to a pocket near the same loop region in
the group 2 HA structure. Mutations in the small α-helix adjacent
to the loop of an H3 HA (E57K) render the virus resistant to the fusion
inhibitor 4c,19 and a similar compound,
TBHQ,20 was shown to interact with E57
through a cocrystal structure. Interestingly, several other structurally
unrelated group 1-specific fusion inhibitors select for resistance
mutations in both the small and large α-helices surrounding
the stalk loop region.14,15,17 During preparation of this paper a group 1-specific compound, MBX2546, was published that has a chemical structure similar
to that of S20.21 This compound
was found to compete for binding to HA with an antibody that is known
to associate with the small α-helix and loop region of the stalk.38 Resistance mutations were not well-defined in
that study, but here we report that mutations that confer S20 resistance also confer resistance to MBX2546 and in
silico docking places MBX2546 in the same pocket as for S20.

Conclusion
Subtype specificity appears
to be a hallmark
(and a major hurdle for development) of small molecule fusion inhibitors
that target this region of the HA protein. Further investigation of S20, and other group 1-specific inhibitors in conjunction
with the group 2-specific compounds, could lead to a greater understanding
of this inhibition and future development of pan-subtype small molecule
fusion inhibitors. It should be noted that the region identified as
the binding site for S20, and other HA fusion inhibitors,
overlaps with the epitopes of broadly neutralizing HA antibodies39−42 that, like the small molecules, are either group 1- or group 2-specific.
Nevertheless, there are massive efforts underway to design vaccines
that elicit such antibodies with the goal of developing a “universal”
influenza vaccine,43,44 which would protect over many
years as opposed to the current seasonal vaccine. With antiviral drugs,
it is likely that future influenza therapies will use a combination
of virus-specific compounds to increase efficacy and decrease incidents
of viral resistance, much like HAART for treatment of HIV infections.
Therefore, it is possible that two subtype specific fusion inhibitors
could be paired with a drug targeting a disparate stage of the viral
life cycle, such as oseltamivir, to produce an effective triple therapy.

In conclusion, we have found a group 1 influenza A virus specific
inhibitor that targets HA-mediated viral-host membrane fusion. This
inhibition is most likely due to S20 directly binding
to the stalk loop region of the HA protein and stabilizing it from
the acid-induced conformational change required to undergo fusion.
Future studies aimed at obtaining a cocrystal of the S20–HA complex will add to the understanding of structural differences
between group 1 versus group 2 fusion inhibitors and perhaps lead
to the design of more effective drug-like candidates in the future.

Methods
Cell Culture and Reagents
Madin–Darby canine
kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells, human alveolar epithelial (A549) cells,
and human embryonic kidney 293T (293T) cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Production
of the MDCK cell line stably expressing the WSN HA protein was previously
described.24 MDCK, A549, and 293T cells
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (HyClone, South Logan, UT, USA) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin
(P/S) (Gibco). All cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transfection of DNA was performed in Opti-MEM I-reduced serum medium
(Opti-MEM) (Gibco) with Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) in A549 cells
according to the manufacturer’s specifications. For measurement
of luciferase production in reporter assays, the Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used. The Renilla-Glo
Luciferase Assay System was used in the high-throughput primary screen
and confirmation screen (Promega).

Expression Plasmids and
Cloning
The pRL-TK (Promega)
reporter contains a Renilla luciferase gene under
the regulation of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter.
The influenza A virus minigenome reporter (pPolI NP_Luc) was generated
as previously described.25 The influenza
virus rescue plasmid pPolI-HA M59I was generated by exchanging one
nucleotide in the parental plasmid pPolI-HA using the QuickChange
site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE,
USA) using specific primers (forward 5′-ctctgttatcgagaaaataaacactcaattcacagctgtgg-3′;
reverse: 5′-ccacagctgtgaattgagtgtttattttctcgataacagag-3′).
The presence of the mutation was confirmed by sequencing (Macrogen,
Rockville, MD, USA). The mammalian expression vector pCAGGS containing
a chicken β-actin promoter has been previously described.26 The expression plasmid encoding the HA M59I
mutant was generated by subcloning from pPolI HA M59I into pCAGGS-HA
using ClaI and NheI enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA).
Proper insertion and presence of the mutation were confirmed by sequencing
(Macrogen).

Viruses
The WSN-Renilla virus construction
was previously described.27 The influenza
A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) virus (WSN) was propagated in MDCK cells for 2 days
at 37 °C. Influenza A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) virus was propagated
in MDCK cells for 3 days at 35 °C. Influenza viruses A/Puerto
Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8), A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2), A/Panama/2007/1999
(H3N2), A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2), A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2), A/Wyoming/03/2003
(H3N2), and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) bearing a mutated polybasic
cleavage site in the HA segment (HAlo) were propagated in 10-day-old
embryonated chicken eggs for 2 days at 37 °C. Influenza B/Yamagata/16/1988
virus was propagated in 8-day-old embryonated chicken eggs for 3 days
at 33 °C. All influenza viruses were titered by standard plaque
assay in MDCK cells.19 Vesicular stomatitis
virus was grown and titered by plaque assay in VERO cells. Recombinant
influenza viruses were generated using the influenza virus rescue
protocol as previously described.28 Briefly,
293T cells were transfected with eight pPolI constructs expressing
the PB1, PB2, PA, NP, HA (or HA M59I), NA, M, and NS genomic segments
as well as pCAGGS expression plasmids encoding the PB1, PB2, PA, and
NP proteins. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, MDCK cells were
cocultured with the transfected 293Ts for an additional 24–48
h, until cytopathic effects were observed. Newly generated viruses
were collected and plaque-purified, and the presence of the mutation
was confirmed by sequencing.

Small Molecular Weight Compounds
Compounds for the
high-throughput screen were from the academic library at the Genomics
Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) (San Diego, CA,
USA). For secondary analyses, hit compounds were purchased from the
vendors indicated through eMolecules (La Jolla, CA, USA) and dissolved
in 100% DMSO. The final concentration of DMSO in the culture medium
did not exceed 0.5%.

High-Throughput Small Molecule Screen Assay
The high-throughput
small molecule screen was performed in 1536-well microplate format.
MDCK cells stably expressing hemagglutinin (MDCK-HA) were cultured
to 80–90% confluency, washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS, Life Technologies), trypsinized with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Life
Technologies), and resuspended in 1× DMEM (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies), 1% penicillin–streptomycin/glutamine
(P/S/G), and 0.15% sodium bicarbonate (Life Technologies). The cells
were then pelleted and resuspended in DMEM containing 1% FBS, 0.3%
bovine albumin (Sigma), 20 mM HEPES, and 1% P/S/G to a cell density
of 5 × 105 cells/mL. Using an automated high-throughput
screening system (GNF Systems), 4 μL of the diluted MDCK-HA
cells was dispensed into 1536-well plates (2000 cells/well) and incubated
at 37 °C and 5% CO2 overnight. Compounds were then
added to each well (10 nL) using a pintool-equipped automated transfer
system (GNF Systems) to a final concentration of 2 μM and a
final DMSO concentration of 0.2% and incubated at 37 °C and 5%
CO2 for 2 h. Next, the cells were infected with 1 μL
of recombinant WSN-Renilla luciferase virus (WSN-Ren)
at an MOI of 0.05 and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Thirty hours postinfection, 2 μL of Renilla-Glo (Promega) was added to each well, and Renilla luciferase activity was measured with a ViewLux uHTS Microplate
Imager (PerkinElmer). For data analysis, on each plate, the last four
columns were reserved for positive (ribavirin, oseltamivir) and negative
(DMSO) controls. For each plate, original signal readings were divided
by plate median; that is, signals from positive controls were around
zero and plate medians were one after normalization. Wells with activity
below a cutoff value 0.5 corresponded to >50% inhibition and were
designated as hits.

Cell Viability Assay
The CellTiterGlo
Cell Viability
Assay (Promega) was used to detect ATP levels as a function of cell
viability, according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
A549 cells were seeded into 96-well plates (1250 cells/well) and incubated
at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h. Culture medium was then
replaced with 100 μL of fresh medium containing compound (serially
diluted), and this was further incubated for 24 h. Cell viability
was measured by adding 50 μL of CellTiterGlo reagent to each
well, and the luminescence signal was read using a plate reader (Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA, USA).

Viral Growth Assays in the Presence of Inhibitors
A549
cells (100,000) were seeded into 24-well plates and incubated for
24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Two hours before infection,
the medium was replaced with DMEM containing the compound of interest
at the indicated concentrations. Compounds were absent during the
1 h virus incubation but were present in the DMEM postinfection medium.
Infections were performed at a low MOI (0.01–0.1) for 24 or
48 h, depending on virus used. For infections with influenza viruses,
postinfection medium also contained 1 ug/mL TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA). The infected cells were incubated at 37 °C
with the exception of influenza B virus-infected cells, which were
incubated at 33 °C. Viral titers were determined by standard
plaque assay in MDCK cells.

Selection of S20-Resistant Influenza Viruses
The concentration
of S20 required for maximum virus inhibition (3 logs),
while maintaining enough virus production for subsequent passages,
was determined (0.5 μM S20). A549 cells were infected
with WSN at an MOI of 0.01 for 24 h at 37 °C under S20 treatment. The supernatant was then collected and titered by plaque
assay. If the recovered S20-treated virus did not show
increased viral titer similar to that of the DMSO-treated control,
the virus was passaged again by using the same method. Once increased
titers in the presence of S20 were detected for two consecutive
passages, the viruses were plaque purified. Following plaque purification,
all eight genome segments were sequenced and compared to DMSO-treated
control virus to detect escape mutations.

Influenza Virus Mini-genome
Assays
For influenza A
virus mini-genome reporter assays, A549 cells were transfected with
lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen). Transfections were done in 12-well
plates at a lipid/DNA ratio of 3:1 (μL/μg). Seventy-five
nanograms of WSN pPolI NP-LUC reporter, 50 ng of pRL-TK reporter,
50 ng of WSN PB1, WSN PB2, and WSN PA expression plasmids, and 100
ng of WSN NP expression plasmid (or empty vector for negative control)
were cotransfected in 100 μL of Opti-MEM. Incubation of lipid
and DNA was done at room temperature for 30 min prior to addition
of the transfection complex directly to cells containing DMEM supplemented
with S20 or DMSO. Twenty-four hours post-transfection,
cells were lysed and luciferase production was measured with the Dual-Luciferase
Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
specifications.

Hemolysis Inhibition Assay
Fresh
chicken erythrocytes
(RBC) were washed twice with PBS and resuspended to make a 2% (v/v)
suspension in PBS that was stored at 4 °C until use. One hundred
microliters of RBCs in PBS was mixed with an equal volume of virus
stock. After incubation of the virus–RBC mixture on ice for
30 min, compound was added at the indicated concentrations, and the
sample was incubated for an additional 10 min on ice. To trigger hemolysis,
the sample was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in
200 μL of PBS at the indicated pH values and mixed well. The
mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to allow for the HA
acidification and hemolysis to take place. To separate nonlysed erythrocytes,
samples were centrifuged again at 3000 rpm for 5 min. One hundred
microliters of supernatant was transferred to a flat-bottom 96-well
plate, and absorbance at 340 nm was read on a microtiter plate reader.

HA Purification and Trypsin Protection Assay
Baculovirus-expressed
HA was purified as previously described.29 To determine if a compound stabilizes HA native structure in an
acidic environment, the sensitivity of HA to trypsin digestion was
determined in which only conformationally changed HA resulting from
a low-pH treatment is cleavable by trypsin. Purified HA (4–6
mg) was incubated with test compound or controls at 31 °C for
15 min. The mixture was adjusted with 0.25 M citrate (pH 4.2) to a
final pH of 5.0 and incubated for another 15 min at 31 °C. The
pH was then neutralized with 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, to the final
pH of 7.5. Two milligrams of trypsin was added to each reaction, and
digestion was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C. Trypsin-mediated
HA cleavage was visualized on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel that was stained
with Coomassie blue G-250.

S20 Biolayer Interferometry Binding Assay
Real-time
binding assays between S20 and purified influenza A/WSN/33
virus HA protein were performed using biolayer interferometry on an
Octet Red system (Fortebio, Menlo Park, CA, USA). This system monitors
interference of light reflected from the surface of a fiber optic
sensor to measure the thickness of molecules bound to the sensor surface.
Purified baculovirus expressed HA protein was produced as previously
described.29 Purified HA was randomly biotinylated
with a 1:1 molar ratio using the EZ-Link Micro-PEO4-Biotinylation
kit (Pierce/ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL, USA). Excess biotinylation
reagent was removed using Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (Pierce/ThermoFisher).
Biotinylated HA was coupled to kinetics grade Super Streptavidin high
binding biosensors (Fortebio). Sensors coated with HA were allowed
to bind to S20 in PBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 and 10%
DMSO at increasing concentrations. Binding kinetics were calculated
using the Octet Red software package, which determined the best fit
for the observed binding curves and calculated the association rate
constants. S20 was allowed to dissociate by incubation
of the sensors in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 and 10% DMSO. Best fit dissociation
curves were determined, and the dissociation rate constants were calculated.
Binding affinities were calculated as the kinetic dissociation rate
constant divided by the kinetic association rate constant.

NMR Spectroscopy
NMR spectra were acquired on a 600
MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm TCI cryoprobe.
All NMR experiments were performed at 298 K, and data were processed
and analyzed using TOPSPIN 2.1 (Bruker Biospin Corp., Billerica, MA,
USA). Saturation transfer difference (STD) experiments were acquired
with a 2 s presaturation time obtained with a train of selective 5
ms IBURP pulses centered at 0.5 ppm or at 20 ppm in the off-resonance
experiment.47 The experiments were acquired
with 4096 scans, 512 data points, and a spectral window of 12 ppm.

Molecular Docking of S20 to the HA Protein
Docking
studies were performed using MOE 2013.08 in the Amber10 force field.
The crystal structures of the A/PR/8/34 (PDB 1RU7), A/Hong Kong/68
(PDB ID 2YPG), or A/Vietnam/04 HA (PDB ID 2FK0) proteins were retrieved from the Protein
Data Bank (http://www.rcsborg/pdb/home/home.do). To prepare
the proteins for docking studies, they were loaded into MOE and all
water molecules and heteroatoms were removed. As the protein is a
homotrimer, all protein chains were considered for the docking process.
The structure was protonated, polar hydrogens were added, and energy
minimization was carried out to obtain the stabilized conformation.
A docking procedure was followed using the induced-fit protocol implemented
in MOE 2013.08. After successful docking, the best energy conformations
of receptor–ligand complexes were studied and evaluated to
infer the most probable predicted binding site.
