    "#Big Data Finals - Word Co-occurnce in pubMed database\n",

    "###Problem Statement\n",
    "For this project, I will utilize the Pubmed Central (PMC) open access dataset, implement a system to process the PMC dataset with a user-provided term, and generate a JSON file for use in D3-driven visualization. The goal of this final is to produce a visualization of the topics that most commonly co-occur in the pubmed documents with a user provided term or phrase.\n",

    "###Introduction\n",
    "PubMed database contains millions of documents related to various articles. Searching through all of the dat manually is a very daunting (sort of impossible task). Hence, I wll be attempting to help explore the database with minimal effort. The basic idea is given a word, find all other words which are co-occuring. There are various ways to approach this problem. \n",
    "The approach which I have implemented is as follows: I will be scanning the entire database for this word. I will see which documents contains this word. And after that, I will be selecting the other words based on their co-occurrence in the document.\n",
    "Again, this can be done in various ways. But before I delve into the nifty details, let's first cover some of the basics of text mining which I learnt during the course of this project. This will be helpful in understanding the underlying concept of the application.\n",
    "- Tokenization: Tokenization is the process of breaking a stream of text up into words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements called tokens. The list of tokens becomes input for further processing such as parsing or text mining.\n",
    "- Stop Words: In computing, stop words are words which are filtered out prior to, or after, processing of natural language data (text). In terms of linguistics these words are called as function words. Words like ’a’, ’an’, ’the’ are examples for stop words. There is no defined set of stop words available. Different applications and research groups uses different sets o stop words.\n",
    "Generally stop words are omitted in text mining process. The frequency of stop words will be very high in any corpus compared to content words.Pointers to some good stop word list is available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words\n",
    "- Bag of Words: The bag-of-words model is a simplifying representation used in natural language processing and information retrieval (IR). In this model, a text (such as a sentence or a document) is represented as an un-ordered collection of words, disregarding grammar and even word order. Analyzing text by only analyzing frequency of words is called as bag of words model.\n",
    "- TF-IDF: Tf–idf, term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic which reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.\n",
